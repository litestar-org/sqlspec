Try SQLSpec directly in your browser. The playground runs a sandboxed Python runtime
using WebAssembly and an in-memory SQLite database seeded with sample data.

Overview
--------

- Run Python code that imports SQLSpec.
- Execute SQL with syntax highlighting.
- Inspect rows or rows affected in the output panel.

Usage Tips
----------

- Use the SQL panel for quick queries against the seeded ``teams`` table.
- Switch to the Python panel to explore the API or define your own tables.
- Reset buttons restore the default snippets.
