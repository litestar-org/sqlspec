# Testing Guide for SQLSpec

This document describes how we execute and structure tests across SQLSpec. It reflects our current strategy of using **pytest + pytest-databases** (with Docker services) and **pytest-xdist** for parallel execution. Follow these instructions whenever you add, update, or run tests locally or in CI.

---

## 1. Test Command Reference

We invoke pytest directly through `uv` so we share the same virtual environment management in local dev and CI. The most common commands are:

- **Full suite (unit + integration + lint gates configured elsewhere):**

  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```

- **Single file:**

  ```bash
  uv run pytest tests/integration/test_asyncpg_driver.py
  ```

- **Single test (node id):**

  ```bash
  uv run pytest tests/unit/adapters/test_asyncpg_config.py::test_validation
  ```

- **Parallel run (recommended by default):**

  ```bash
  uv run pytest -n auto
  ```

  We rely on `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto`) to scale across CPU cores. Keep thread-safety in mind; most of our fixtures are session-scoped, so they are safe to share across workers. If you add fixtures that cannot be shared, mark them `scope="function"` or use `xdist_worker_id` to isolate resources.

---

## 2. pytest-databases Overview

We depend on [`pytest-databases`](https://github.com/litestar-org/pytest-databases) to launch containerized databases on demand. **Never call `make infra-up` or `make infra-down` in tests**—pytest-databases handles lifecycle automatically.

### 2.1 Enable Plugins

To make services available, list the plugins at module import time (usually in `tests/conftest.py`):

```python
pytest_plugins = [
    "pytest_databases.docker.postgres",
    "pytest_databases.docker.mysql",
    "pytest_databases.docker.oracle",
    # add others as needed (redis, elasticsearch, etc.)
]
```

Each plugin contributes fixtures ending with `_service` (preferred) and `_connection` (currently available but being evaluated). **Use the service fixtures** so we’re ready if direct connection fixtures are deprecated.

### 2.2 Service Fixtures

- `postgres_service`, `mysql_service`, `oracle_service`, etc. provide access to host, port, credentials, and utility helpers.
- All drivers that target the same database flavour share the same underlying container. For example, `asyncpg`, `psycopg`, and `psqlpy` all point at the PostgreSQL service spun up by `postgres_service`.
- Fixtures are usually **session-scoped** so databases start once per pytest session, which keeps setup fast and reduces container churn.

Example usage:

```python
from pytest_databases.docker.postgres import PostgresService

def test_round_trip(postgres_service: PostgresService) -> None:
    url = postgres_service.connection_url()
    # Use url in SQLSpec config, run migrations once, run assertions…
```

Avoid calling `postgres_service.connection` or `postgres_connection` directly unless there is no alternative; we prefer to construct SQLSpec configs and drivers using the service metadata and reuse our own fixture helpers (see below).

---

## 3. SQLSpec Testing Fixtures

We provide shared fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` to keep tests DRY and ensure consistent setup across drivers. When adding tests:

- Reuse existing config/driver fixtures (e.g., `asyncpg_driver`, `psycopg_sync_driver`) instead of creating new ones.
- Keep fixtures at `session` or `module` scope whenever possible. This allows us to deploy DDL once per service instead of per test.
- Store DDL scripts under `tests/fixtures/postgres/`, `tests/fixtures/mysql/`, etc. Use helper utilities from `tests/fixtures/sql_utils.py` to apply them.
- If you need pre-populated data, prefer fixture-level setup functions that insert data during `setup` once.

### Example Pattern

```python
import pytest
from sqlspec import SQLSpec
from sqlspec.adapters.asyncpg import AsyncpgConfig
from tests.fixtures.sql_utils import apply_ddl

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def asyncpg_config(postgres_service):
    return AsyncpgConfig(
        pool_config={"dsn": postgres_service.connection_url()},
        extension_config={"litestar": {"session_table": "litestar_sessions"}},
    )

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def asyncpg_driver(asyncpg_config):
    spec = SQLSpec()
    config = spec.add_config(asyncpg_config)
    apply_ddl(config, "tests/fixtures/postgres/basic_schema.sql")
    with spec.provide_driver(config) as driver:
        yield driver
```

The combination ensures:

1. The container is started via `postgres_service`.
2. Configuration is stored once per session.
3. DDL executes once per session (fast) rather than per test.

## 4. Database Isolation & Data Management

- Because we share containers across tests, **start each test in a known state**. Prefer truncating tables or using transaction rollbacks within the test when data isolation is required.
- For write-heavy suites, consider wrapping tests in `BEGIN … ROLLBACK` using driver transaction fixtures. If the driver does not support nested transactions, reset tables via fixture-level finalizers.
- Use fixture-scoped DB objects (schemas, tables) with unique names to avoid cross-test collisions.

---

## 5. Organising Tests

Directory structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/          # no external services
├── integration/   # requires services (postgres, mysql, etc.)
├── fixtures/      # shared fixtures, ddl scripts, utilities
└── conftest.py    # pytest plugins, global fixtures
```

Guidelines:

- Unit tests should never depend on pytest-databases.
- Integration tests must declare their service dependencies via fixtures and should be marked with meaningful pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.postgres`, `@pytest.mark.oracle`) to enable targeted runs (e.g., `uv run pytest -m postgres`).
- When you add a new adapter or driver, create or reuse fixture modules under `tests/fixtures/<adapter>/`.

---

## 6. Parallel Execution with pytest-xdist

We run with `-n auto` by default. Keep in mind:

- Each worker receives its own copy of fixtures respecting scope. Session-scoped fixtures run once—`pytest-databases` is compatible with xdist because services are globally shared via Docker.
- If you need worker-specific isolation, inspect `request.node` or `xdist_worker_id` in your fixture and adjust resource names accordingly (e.g., create per-worker schemas).
- Ensure DDL scripts are idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS…`) when using session-scoped fixtures.

---

## 7. Markers & CI Filtering

We register markers in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `postgres`, `mysql`, `oracle`, `integration`). When writing tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.postgres
async def test_asyncpg_insert(asyncpg_driver):
    ...
```

This lets us run `uv run pytest -m postgres` locally and use the marker selectors in CI pipelines.

---

## 8. Linting & Static Checks

Tests follow the same linting and type checking rules as production code. Use:

- `uv run ruff check tests/`
- `uv run mypy tests/`

Keep fixtures typed—the more explicit the types, the easier it is to detect broken signatures when pytest-databases updates.

---

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- Don’t start/stop Docker containers manually. Rely on pytest-databases services.
- Prefer service fixtures over connection fixtures to stay future-proof.
- Reuse global fixtures from `tests/fixtures/` rather than duplicating DDL/application setup in individual test modules.
- Ensure teardown logic runs: use `yield` fixtures and finalizers to close drivers, truncate tables, or drop schemas if necessary.
- Document new fixtures and add them to the markdown guides so other contributors know they exist.

By following these guidelines, the SQLSpec suite remains fast, reliable, and consistent across local development and CI environments. When in doubt, check existing integration tests for patterns you can extend.*** End Patch
