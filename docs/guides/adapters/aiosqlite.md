# aiosqlite Adapter Guide

This guide provides specific instructions for the `aiosqlite` adapter.

## Key Information

- **Driver:** `aiosqlite`
- **Parameter Style:** `qmark` (e.g., `?`)

## Best Practices

- **Async Only:** This is an asynchronous driver for SQLite. Use it in `asyncio` applications.
- **Concurrency:** While `aiosqlite` provides async access, SQLite itself has limitations on concurrent writes. For highly concurrent applications, consider a different database like PostgreSQL.

## Common Issues

- **`sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`**: Same as the sync `sqlite3` driver, this occurs when multiple writers conflict. Ensure your application design avoids simultaneous writes.
