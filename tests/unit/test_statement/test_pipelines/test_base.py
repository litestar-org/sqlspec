"""Unit tests for SQL processing pipeline base components.

This module tests the core pipeline framework including:
- UsesExpression utility for expression conversion
- StatementPipeline for orchestrating SQL processing
- SQLValidator for validation orchestration
- ProcessorProtocol interface
- Error handling and pipeline execution

NOTE: This test file needs to be refactored as UsesExpression and SQLValidator
classes have been removed from the codebase.
