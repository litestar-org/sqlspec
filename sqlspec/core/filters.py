"""Preserved filter system with exact same interfaces.

This module preserves the existing StatementFilter system completely unchanged,
as it already works correctly and drivers depend on the exact interfaces.

CRITICAL: NO CHANGES to filter classes - they provide essential functionality
for dynamic SQL construction and drivers use them extensively.

Classes Preserved:
- StatementFilter: Base ABC for all filters
- WhereFilter: WHERE clause filtering
- LimitFilter: LIMIT/OFFSET filtering  
- OrderByFilter: ORDER BY clause filtering
- GroupByFilter: GROUP BY clause filtering
- HavingFilter: HAVING clause filtering

The filter system is already well-designed and performant. Making changes
would only introduce risk without meaningful benefit for the core optimization goals.

Preservation Strategy:
- Exact copy from current statement/filters.py
- Same class hierarchy and inheritance
- Same method signatures and behavior  
- Same integration with SQL class
- Same builder pattern interfaces
