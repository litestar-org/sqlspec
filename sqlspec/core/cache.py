"""Unified cache system replacing all current cache layers.

This module implements a single high-performance cache that replaces:
1. SQL parsing/compilation cache (statement/cache.py)
2. Driver-specific query caches
3. Parameter processing caches
4. AST fragment caches

Key Performance Improvements:
- Single cache eliminates cache coordination overhead
- LRU eviction with O(1) operations using OrderedDict
- Cache-aware compilation to avoid redundant processing
- Memory-efficient storage with shared immutable results
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access

Architecture:
- UnifiedCache: Main cache implementation with LRU eviction
- CacheKey: Composite key generation for different cache types
- CacheStats: Performance monitoring and metrics
- Cache-aware integration with SQLProcessor and drivers

Performance Targets:
- 60% reduction in memory usage from cache consolidation
- 10x faster cache operations with O(1) LRU implementation
- Thread-safe concurrent access without lock contention
- Configurable cache size limits per cache type
